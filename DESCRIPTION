Description: provides example one-dimensional proton NMR spectra of murine urine 
    samples collected before and after bariatric or sham surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). 
    The data are adapted from Jia V Li et al. (2011), "Metabolic surgery profoundly 
    influences gut microbial-host metabolic cross-talk", Gut, 60(9), 1214â€“1223. 
    doi:10.1136/gut.2010.234708. This package serves as example data for 
    metabolomics analysis and teaching purposes.
